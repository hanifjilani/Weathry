## Weathry

<p>
This project takes the user to a exceptionally and quirky website in which the user and enter a location. The website then uses Nodejs to make a call to OpenWeatherMap API to get the weather info needed, that then depending upon the weather, it will dyanamically change the page that the user will see and will display the weather info.

I also added a about me, contact and blog page. The contact page is connected to my email using NodeMailer (a Nodejs Email Module). The blog page wasn't created to actually write lots of blogs. I am always fascinated by things I see everyday and one such thing was blogs. I loved how blog websites looked and I wanted to implement and design a blog page from scratch using HTML and CSS. Hence I made the blog page and added it to my website.

This is the first independent project I did after I completed my self-learning using Udemy, youtube and other online resources. I did is project a while ago (around 3 years ago I believe!). 

This project taught me a lot and made me extremely excited and actually aided a lot to passion for Computer Science.
